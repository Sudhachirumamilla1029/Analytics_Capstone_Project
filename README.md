### Targeted Problem:
##### How can we construct an effective predictive framework for distinguishing students likely to succeed academically from those at risk of dropping out in educational institutions. 

### Research Question:
##### What strategies and techniques can be effectively employed to achieve precise predictions regarding students at risk of dropout and those on track for academic success?

### Dataset:
##### A dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The data is used to build classification models to predict students' dropout and academic sucess. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there is a strong imbalance towards one of the classes.
